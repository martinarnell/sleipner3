    question: 'What if Sleipner doesn&apos;t save us money?',
    answer: 'You pay nothing. Our pricing is 100% performance-basedâ€”if we don\'t deliver savings, we don\'t get paid.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API?',
    answer: 'Yes. You only need to change the base URL to our proxy endpoint and add your API key. Your existing code will work without any other changes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What models do you support?',
    answer: 'We support a wide range of models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open-source alternatives. Our routing system automatically selects the best model for each query based on cost and quality.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I set a maximum cost or model tier?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. You have full control to set spending limits and define the maximum model tier (e.g., never escalate beyond GPT-4o) to prevent unexpected costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure quality?',
    answer: 'We use a proprietary grading system with independent "judge" models to score every response for accuracy and helpfulness. You can also enable optional self-correction mechanisms for tasks like code generation.',
