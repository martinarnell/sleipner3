# Multi-Dimensional Rubric Scoring System

## Overview

The Multi-Dimensional Rubric Scoring System is an advanced AI response quality evaluation framework that replaces simple single-score grading with sophisticated, context-aware analysis across five key dimensions. This system intelligently routes queries between tier-0 (fast) and tier-1 (premium) models based on comprehensive quality assessment.

## Key Features

- **5-Dimensional Evaluation**: Accuracy, Completeness, Clarity, Depth, Safety
- **Question-Type Awareness**: Adaptive scoring criteria based on question complexity
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent evaluation across all dimensions for speed
- **Confidence Metrics**: Per-dimension confidence scores and variance analysis
- **Research-Based**: Built on academic frameworks (HELM, GLIDER, RouterBench)

## Architecture

```
User Query → Question Classifier → Multi-Dimensional Scorer → Routing Decision
                                    ↓
            Accuracy + Completeness + Clarity + Depth + Safety
                                    ↓
                      Weighted Composite Score → Pass/Fail
```

## Question Classification

The system automatically classifies questions into five categories with appropriate evaluation criteria:

### FACTUAL (Threshold: 85/100)
- **Purpose**: Basic facts, definitions, math, simple "what is" questions
- **Examples**: "What is the capital of France?", "What is 2+2?", "When was WWII?"
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Accuracy: 40% (most important)
  - Completeness: 30%
  - Clarity: 20%
  - Depth: 5% (minimal requirement)
  - Safety: 5%

### ANALYTICAL (Threshold: 75/100)
- **Purpose**: Business analysis, strategy, economic evaluation, complex reasoning
- **Examples**: "Analyze market trends", "Develop a strategy", "Compare business models"
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Depth: 35% (most important)
  - Accuracy: 25%
  - Completeness: 20%
  - Clarity: 15%
  - Safety: 5%

### TECHNICAL (Threshold: 80/100)
- **Purpose**: Specific technical knowledge, procedures, code, domain expertise
- **Examples**: "Configure Kubernetes", "Debug this code", "Medical diagnosis"
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Accuracy: 35%
  - Completeness: 30%
  - Clarity: 20%
  - Depth: 10%
  - Safety: 5%

### CREATIVE (Threshold: 70/100)
- **Purpose**: Original content creation, artistic expression, storytelling
- **Examples**: "Write a poem", "Create a story", "Design an advertisement"
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Completeness: 25%
  - Clarity: 25%
  - Depth: 25%
  - Accuracy: 15%
  - Safety: 10%

### ETHICAL (Threshold: 75/100)
- **Purpose**: Moral judgments, values, sensitive topics
- **Examples**: "Is X right or wrong?", "Should we do Y?", "Political opinions"
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - All dimensions equally weighted at 20%
  - Safety particularly important

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Accuracy (Scale: 1-10)
**Measures**: Factual correctness and freedom from errors

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- 9-10: Completely accurate, all facts verified
- 7-8: Mostly accurate with minor imprecisions
- 5-6: Some inaccuracies present
- 1-4: Major factual errors or misinformation

**Prompt**: "Rate factual accuracy: Are facts correct? No misinformation? Numbers, dates, claims accurate?"

### 2. Completeness (Scale: 1-10)
**Measures**: Thoroughness in addressing all aspects of the question

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- 9-10: Completely comprehensive, all aspects covered
- 7-8: Covers most aspects thoroughly
- 5-6: Covers main points but misses details
- 1-4: Incomplete, major gaps

**Prompt**: "Rate completeness: All parts answered? Key aspects covered? Missing information?"

### 3. Clarity (Scale: 1-10)
**Measures**: Clear communication and readability

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- 9-10: Exceptionally clear and well-structured
- 7-8: Clear with good organization
- 5-6: Generally clear but could be clearer
- 1-4: Unclear or poorly structured

**Prompt**: "Rate clarity: Easy to understand? Logical structure? Complex concepts explained simply?"

### 4. Depth (Scale: 1-10)
**Measures**: Level of analysis, insight, and sophistication

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- 9-10: Deep analysis with exceptional insights
- 7-8: Good depth with solid analysis
- 5-6: Moderate depth, some analysis
- 1-4: Shallow or superficial

**Prompt**: "Rate depth: Meaningful insights? Appropriate detail level? Underlying concepts explored?"

### 5. Safety (Scale: 1-10)
**Measures**: Absence of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- 9-10: Completely safe and appropriate
- 7-8: Safe with minor concerns
- 5-6: Generally safe but some issues
- 1-4: Safety or ethical concerns present

**Prompt**: "Rate safety: Free from harmful advice? No ethical concerns? Appropriate tone?"

## Scoring Algorithm

### Weighted Composite Calculation
```javascript
weightedScore = (
  accuracy_score * accuracy_weight +
  completeness_score * completeness_weight +
  clarity_score * clarity_weight +
  depth_score * depth_weight +
  safety_score * safety_weight
) * 10  // Scale to 100

pass = weightedScore >= question_type_threshold
```

### Confidence Metrics
- **Individual Confidence**: Each dimension provides confidence (0.0-1.0)
- **Average Confidence**: Mean confidence across all dimensions
- **Variance**: Consistency measure across dimension scores

## Usage Examples

### Testing Simple Factual Question
```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-sleipner-debug: full" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ],
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**:
- Classification: FACTUAL
- Score: 90-98/100
- Threshold: 85
- Routing: tier-0 (passed)

### Testing Complex Analytical Question
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-sleipner-debug: full" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the competitive advantages of subscription vs one-time purchase business models"}
    ],
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**:
- Classification: ANALYTICAL
- Score: 70-95/100 (depends on tier-0 quality)
- Threshold: 75
- Routing: tier-0 if >75, tier-1 if <75

## Configuration

### Question Type Thresholds
Adjust in `QUESTION_TYPE_WEIGHTS`:
```javascript
const QUESTION_TYPE_WEIGHTS = {
  FACTUAL: { threshold: 85 },     // High bar for simple facts
  ANALYTICAL: { threshold: 75 },  // Moderate for analysis
  TECHNICAL: { threshold: 80 },   // High for technical accuracy
  CREATIVE: { threshold: 70 },    // Lower for creative content
  ETHICAL: { threshold: 75 }      // Balanced approach
};
```

### Dimension Weights
Modify weight distributions per question type:
```javascript
FACTUAL: { 
  accuracy: 0.40,      // Accuracy most important
  completeness: 0.30,
  clarity: 0.20,
  depth: 0.05,         // Minimal depth needed
  safety: 0.05 
}
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Pass Rate by Question Type**: Percentage staying in tier-0
- **Average Confidence Scores**: Reliability indicator
- **Variance Trends**: Consistency of evaluations
- **Cost per Evaluation**: Economic efficiency
- **Classification Accuracy**: Manual validation of question types

### Performance Tuning
1. **Threshold Adjustment**: Based on tier-0 vs tier-1 quality comparison
2. **Weight Optimization**: A/B testing different weight distributions
3. **Classification Refinement**: Improving question type detection
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Enhancing dimension evaluation prompts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High Variance Scores**
